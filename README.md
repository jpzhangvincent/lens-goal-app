Struggle with procrastination until the last moment, have goals you want to achieve but haven't started?

Introducing Lens Goal:

- Publicly state a goal, deadline and proof to be provided utilizing Lens.
- ERC20 tokens locked on chain.
- When achieved, proof posted on Lens
- LensFrens act as an oracle, voting if goal achieved to return funds.
- If goal not achieved, funds transferred to treasury /charity account.


Other users can also sponsor the goal, these funds return to them if the user fails goal.

Tools used: 

Lens Protocol- Leverages existing social networks to be genuinely judged by peers. Enables voting by peers.

Polygon:  Currently utilizing Mumbai testnet. With plan to deploy on Polygon mainnet due to low gas fees helping onboard new web3 users. 

Chainlink: Utilizing Chainlink Automation for monitoring for change in goal status, as well as Chainlink Functions to enable access to private APIs such as Fitbit/Google Fit.


Benefits:
